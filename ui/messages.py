    ### Your Intelligent Trading Assistant for Cryptocurrency Markets
    
    ---
    
    ## üéØ What This System Does
    
    **Crypto Co-pilot AI** is an advanced machine learning system that analyzes cryptocurrency market data to provide intelligent trading signals. Here's how it helps you:
    
    ### üîÆ Key Features:
    
    - **üìä Advanced Technical Analysis**: Combines multiple indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Moving Averages, Volume Analysis)
    - **üß† Machine Learning Predictions**: Uses RandomForest algorithm to predict market movements
    - **üéØ Dual Strategy Modes**: Choose between Dynamic (volatility-based) or Fixed (percentage-based) strategies
    - **‚ö° Real-time Signals**: Get instant BUY/SELL/HOLD recommendations
    - **üìà Performance Tracking**: Monitor accuracy and model performance on historical data
    - **üîÑ Adaptive Learning**: Model adjusts to market conditions automatically
    
    ### üöÄ How It Works:
    
    1. **Data Collection**: Fetches real-time market data from CoinGecko API
    2. **Technical Analysis**: Calculates 15+ technical indicators
    3. **ML Training**: Trains RandomForest model on historical patterns
    4. **Signal Generation**: Provides three types of signals:
       - üü¢ **TAKE PROFIT**: Strong bullish signal (recommended BUY)
       - üî¥ **STOP LOSS**: Strong bearish signal (recommended SELL)
       - ‚ö™ **TIME LIMIT**: Neutral signal (recommended HOLD)
    5. **Performance Validation**: Shows accuracy on test data
    
    ### üí° Benefits for You:
    
    - **Save Time**: No need to manually analyze complex charts
    - **Reduce Emotions**: Data-driven decisions based on AI analysis
    - **Risk Management**: Built-in stop-loss and take-profit levels
    - **Transparency**: See exactly how decisions are made
    - **Flexibility**: Customize strategy parameters to your risk tolerance
