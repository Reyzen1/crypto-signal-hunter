## üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.12:** This project is tested and confirmed to work with Python 3.12.x. **Python 3.13 is not currently supported** due to dependency conflicts.
- **Git:** For cloning the repository.
- **(Windows Users):** Microsoft C++ Build Tools are required for compiling some dependencies. You can download them from [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/).

## üöÄ Getting Started

You can set up and run this project in two ways: the easy way (using the provided scripts) or the manual way.

### The Easy Way (Recommended)

These scripts automate the entire setup and run process. Run them from your terminal (like Git Bash on Windows).

**1. Setup the Environment:**
This script will create a virtual environment and install all necessary dependencies.
```bash
./Setup.sh
```

(Note: You can pass your specific Python version, e.g., 3.12, as an argument.)
```bash
./Setup.sh 3.12
```

**2. Run the Application:**
Once the setup is complete, use this script to start the dashboard.
```bash
./Run.sh
```

### The Manual Way
If you prefer to set up the project manually, follow these steps.

**1. Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Reyzen1/crypto-signal-hunter.git](https://github.com/Reyzen1/crypto-signal-hunter.git)
cd crypto-signal-hunter
```

**2. Create and activate a virtual environment:**
```bash
# Create a venv using Python 3.12
python3.12 -m venv venv

# Activate it
# On Windows (Git Bash or PowerShell)
source venv/Scripts/activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```
**3. Install the required dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application should now open in your web browser!
